                <h2 id="about">About me</h2>
                <p>I am a 4th year undergraduate Computer Science student with a minor in Bioinformatics 
                    at the University of Alberta. I enjoy learning about technology and how they work as
                    well as various computer science topics. But recently I have started to enjoy learning
                    more about network security as well as web development. 
                </p>
                <h2>What I have to offer</h2>
                <p>Being involved in these clubs has exposed me to new problem-solving techniques and 
                    learning new technologies and programming languages; this is a result of listening 
                    to industry professionals and working with fellow undergraduates. My time management and 
                    communication skills developed largely from the interactions with customers and 
                    co-workers as a sales associate. Working in a large-scale company has taught me how to 
                    be a good employee and manage time between school and work. Being an active student 
                    during the week and then working during the weekend has forced me to prioritize and 
                    focus my workflow. I have worked on several projects where I have applied my knowledge
                    and learned new technologies and languages. Developing Noctua has allowed me to learn 
                    a bit about Javascript and Firebase Firestore. While building an app that is essentially 
                    Pokemon Go but for QR codes, I demonstrated my use of various technologies and used scrum
                    methodologies to deliver QRHunt within 4 months. Currently, I am learning and using the 
                    MERN stack to develop a social media website in my web development course and Ruby-on-Rails
                    and PERL in my Bioinformatics course.
                </p>
